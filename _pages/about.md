Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in Mathematics at the University of Bonn, working with [Prof. Jan Hasenauer](https://www.mathematics-and-life-sciences.uni-bonn.de/en/research/hasenauer-group) and affiliated with the [Life & Medical Sciences Institute](https://www.limes-institut-bonn.de/en/research/research-departments/unit-2/hasenauer-lab/hasenauer-lab-home/). My work focuses on mechanistic modelling of biological systems, with the goal of understanding complex cellular and molecular processes through quantitative, interpretable frameworks.

My research spans ODE/SDE modelling, parameter estimation, and uncertainty quantification, often in close collaboration with experimental groups. I have worked on projects investigating RNA stability regulation and oncolytic virus–tumor dynamics, complementing theory with real biological data. Alongside mechanistic approaches, I am increasingly interested in hybrid modelling that combines physics-based models with machine learning.

Beyond mechanistic modelling, I develop computational tools and resources, including the [robustGarch](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/5815940211539968) R package for robust time-series modelling, and multimodal imaging pipelines integrating visual and thermal data for UAV-based search and rescue. I am committed to open, reproducible science, making data and code available in well-documented, reusable form. My work has been presented at conferences across systems biology, computational neuroscience, control theory, and applied mathematics.

I am also deeply interested in teaching, mentoring, and community building. I have taught courses on parameter inference, mentored students at multiple career stages, and helped organize workshops and seminar series aimed at fostering interdisciplinary dialogue between mathematics and the life sciences.

Outside of research, I enjoy road biking and hiking with family and friends, and I have a deep curiosity for the history of mathematics.

<!-- I am also a huge fan of history of mathematics and how it can help us understand how math research has evolved and will evolve in the upcoming years. -->
